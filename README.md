## 🤖 Development Methodology & AI Transparency
I leverage a modern, AI-augmented development workflow to maximize productivity and ensure code quality. These tools act as a "COdeGPT," allowing me to focus on system architecture and solving complex logic.

*   **Content Improvement:** I utilized [CodeGPT](https://codegpt.co) to refine technical descriptions, project summaries, and documentation for maximum clarity.
*   **Error Reporting & Debugging:** [Blackbox AI](https://www.useblackbox.io) was integrated into my workflow for real-time error detection, generating initial boilerplate code, and rapid troubleshooting.
*   **Quality Assurance:** While AI assists in drafting and debugging, every final output is manually reviewed, tested, and validated by me to maintain the highest standards of code integrity and professional tone.
